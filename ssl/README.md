# Overview of SSL/TLS certificates

##  What are SSL certificates ?

> SSL certificate enables encrypted transfer of sensitive information between a client and a server. The purpose of encryption is to make sure that only the intended recipient will be able to view the information. SSL certificates are used to enable https connection between browser and websites.

##  How to generate SSL certificates ?

> There are multiple toolkits available in the market to create self signed SSL certificates. Most notable of them are - 

*  openssl
*  cfssl
*  easyrsa 

> **Self signed certificates** are useful when you want to enable SSL/TLS envryption for applications that run within your organization. These certificates are not recognized by browsers as the certificate is internal to your organization itself. In order to enable communication with any system outside your organization, you will have to set up MSSL/2 way SSL. 

> There are multiple **third party SSL certificate providers** like Verisign, Symantec, Intouch, Comodo etc. Their Certificate public key is embedded with all major browsers like chrome, IE, safari, mozilla. This enables any external user to connect to your server using a secure HTTPS connection that is recognized by the browser.  

#  Components of SSL certificate 

##  Certificate Authority (CA)

> **CA** are third party trusted entities that issues a **trusted SSL certificate**. Trusted certificate are used to create a secure connection (https) from browser/client to a server that accepts the incoming request. When you create a self-signed certificate for your organization, __**YOU**__ become the CA. 

##  Private key/Public key/CSR & Certificate

> SSL uses the concept of **private/public key pair** to authenticate, secure and manage connection between client and server. They work together to ensure TLS handshake takes place, creating a secure connection (https)

> **Private key** creates your digital signature which will eventually be trusted by any client that tries to connect to your server. With help of private key, you generate a **CSR (certificate signing request)**. Private key is kept on the server and the security of the private key is the sole responsibility of your organization. The private key should never leave your organization. 

> In contrast to private key, a **Public Key** can be distributed to multiple clients. Public Key or CSR is usually submitted to a CA like Comodo/Verisign/Entrust etc, and the CSR (formerly created by your private key) is then signed by the CA. This process generates a SSL/TLS certificate that can now be distributed to any client application. Since this certificate is signed by a trusted CA, your end users can now connect securely to your server (which contains the private key) using their browser. 

> Some third party CA also takes care of generating the private/public key pair for you. This, sometimes, is a good option in case you lose your private key or your private key is compromised. The CA provider takes care of re-keying your certificate with a new private key, and the new private key is then handed over to you. 

> When dealing with self signed certificate, its usually the organization that generates the root CA certificate and acts as the sole CA provider. Any subsequent CSR will be then signed by the root CA. This enables organizations to ensure TLS communication for applications which runs internal to them. 

##  Steps to generate a self signed certificate 

*     Choose a toolkit of your choice (openssl / easyrsa / cfssl ) -- We will use cfssl 
*     Generate root CA private key 
*     Generate a root certificate and self-sign it using the CA private key 
*     Distribute the root CA certificate on ALL the machines who wants to trust you
*     For each application/machine create a new private key 
*     Use the private key to generate a public key (CSR)
*     Ensure the Common Name Field (CN) is set accurately as per your IP address / service name or DNS
*     Sign the CSR with root CA private key and root CA certificate to generate the client certificate
*     Distribute the Client certificate to the corresponding application
